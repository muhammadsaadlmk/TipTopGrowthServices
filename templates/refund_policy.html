                            <p>We are committed to delivering the services as described on our website. If we fail to deliver the ordered services within a reasonable timeframe (typically 7-14 days after payment confirmation), you may be eligible for a refund.</p>
                            <p>Due to the nature of our services, we cannot guarantee specific results or outcomes, such as increased earnings, sales, or other benefits that may result from increased social media presence.</p>

                                <li><strong>Partial Delivery:</strong> If we deliver less than 70% of the ordered services within 14 days, you may be eligible for a partial refund proportional to the undelivered services.</li>
                                <li><strong>Service Quality Issues:</strong> If there are significant and demonstrable quality issues with the delivered services that substantially devalue the service (e.g., followers that are removed by TikTok within 48 hours).</li>
